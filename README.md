## Hi there :P
My name is Zavier and I am a rising senior at NYU studying computer science. I am currently actively looking for an internship/full-time job as a software engineer, as I am graduating next year! Some of my hobbies include:
- fashion
- cars
- making music
- and playing sports!

... but my true passion relies in building new things!

Here is my (resume)[./Zavier_Andrianarivo_Resume.pdf] for y'all to look at!

You can reach out to me [here](mailto:zavierand98@gmail.com?cc=zoa215@nyu.edu) for any job related purposes or to just chat about anything!
Look through my [github](github.com/zavierand) to see some of the things that I've built over the passed few years!

Hope to see you around!

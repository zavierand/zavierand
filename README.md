## Hi there :P
My name is Zavier and I am a rising senior at NYU studying computer science. I am currently actively looking for an internshi/full-time job as a software engineer! Some of my hobbies include:
- fashion
- cars
- and making music
but my true passion relies in building new things!

You can reach out to me (here)[mailto:zavierand98@gmail.com?cc=zoa215@nyu.edu] for any job related purposes or to just chat about anything!
Look through my (github)[github.com/zavierand] to see some of the things that I've built over the passed few years!

Hope to see you around!
